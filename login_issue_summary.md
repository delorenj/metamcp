# Summary of the mcp.delo.sh Login Issue Debugging Session

## Summary

The user was unable to log in to the `mcp.delo.sh` application. The debugging session revealed that the frontend server was not starting correctly due to a misconfiguration in the `package.json` file. The issue was resolved by updating the `start` script to correctly start the Next.js application in standalone mode.

## Problem

The user reported a login issue with the `mcp.delo.sh` application. The initial debugging attempt using Chrome DevTools failed due to permission issues. The investigation then shifted to the local development environment, which uses Docker and `mise`.

## Investigation

1.  **Initial Analysis:** The `metamcp` container logs revealed multiple errors, including `spawn bunx EACCES`, `spawn uvx EACCES`, and `Cannot find module 'proxy-from-env'`. These errors indicated that the `bun` and `uv` executables were not executable by the `metamcp` user and that some dependencies were missing.

2.  **Dockerfile Modifications:** The `Dockerfile` was modified to install `bash`, `bun`, and `uv`, and to make the `bun` and `uv` binaries executable using `chmod +x`.

3.  **Image Rebuild and Container Restart:** The Docker image was rebuilt, and the `metamcp` container was restarted. The container logs showed that the `EACCES` errors were resolved, but the frontend server was still not starting.

4.  **Health Check Analysis:** The `mise run health` command revealed that the backend server was healthy, but the frontend server was not. This confirmed that the issue was with the frontend application.

5.  **Frontend Investigation:** The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script was modified to redirect the frontend server's logs to a file for inspection. The logs revealed the following error: `"next start" does not work with "output: standalone" configuration. Use "node .next/standalone/server.js" instead.`

## Solution

The `start` script in the `apps/frontend/package.json` file was modified to correctly start the Next.js application in standalone mode.

```json
"start": "node .next/standalone/server.js"
```

After updating the `package.json` file and rebuilding the Docker image, the frontend server started correctly, and the login issue was resolved.

## Key Takeaways

-   Always check the container logs for errors when debugging containerized applications.
-   Ensure that all executables have the correct permissions.
-   When using a standalone Next.js build, use the correct start command: `node .next/standalone/server.js`.
-   Redirecting logs to a file can be a useful technique for debugging container startup issues.
